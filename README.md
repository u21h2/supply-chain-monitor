# Supply Chain Monitor

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Automated monitoring of the top **PyPI** and **npm** packages for supply chain compromise. Polls both registries for new releases, diffs each release against its predecessor, and uses an LLM to classify diffs as **benign** or **malicious**. By default it calls an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API; Cursor Agent CLI remains available as an optional backend. Malicious findings trigger a Slack alert.

Both ecosystems are monitored by default. Use `--no-pypi` or `--no-npm` to disable one.

## How It Works

Each ecosystem runs its own polling thread but shares the analysis and alerting pipeline.

### Detection Targets

The LLM analysis is prompted to look for:

- Obfuscated code (base64, exec, eval, XOR, encoded strings)
- Network calls to unexpected hosts
- File system writes to startup/persistence locations
- Process spawning and shell commands
- Steganography or data hiding in media files
- Credential and token exfiltration
- Typosquatting indicators

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** — install runtime dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (stdlib covers most of the tool; `requests` is used for Slack uploads)
- **An LLM backend**
  - Default: an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API
  - Optional: [Cursor Agent CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview)

### OpenAI-Compatible Configuration

Set these environment variables before running the monitor:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4.1-mini"
# Optional when using a non-OpenAI provider or local gateway:
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example/v1"
# Optional request sizing / retry controls:
export SCM_DIFF_CHAR_LIMIT=300000
export SCM_LLM_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
```

Supported aliases:

- `SCM_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SCM_OPENAI_MODEL`
- `SCM_OPENAI_BASE_URL`

If `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is omitted, the tool uses `https://api.openai.com/v1`. `SCM_DIFF_CHAR_LIMIT` is a character-count request guard, not an exact model token context limit. The default OpenAI-compatible backend retries failed LLM calls up to `SCM_LLM_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times; the default is `3`.

### Installing Cursor Agent CLI (Optional)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm 'https://cursor.com/install?win32=true' | iex
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
```

Verify with:
```bash
agent --version
```

You must be authenticated with Cursor (`agent login` or set `CURSOR_API_KEY`) if you choose `--llm-backend cursor`.

### Slack Configuration

Place your Slack bot token in `etc/slack.json`:

```json
{
    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
    "bot_token": "xoxb-...",
    "channel": "C01XXXXXXXX"
}
```

The bot needs `chat:write` scope on the target channel. The `channel` field is the Slack channel ID where alerts are posted.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configure the default OpenAI-compatible backend
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4.1-mini"

# One-shot: analyze releases from the last ~10 minutes
python monitor.py --once

# Continuous: monitor top 1000 packages (both ecosystems), poll every 5 min
python monitor.py --top 1000 --interval 300

# Production: monitor top 15000, alert to Slack
python monitor.py --top 15000 --interval 300 --slack

# npm only, top 5000
python monitor.py --no-pypi --npm-top 5000

# PyPI only
python monitor.py --no-npm
```

## File Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `monitor.py` | **Main orchestrator** — poll PyPI + npm, diff, analyze, alert (parallel threads) |
| `pypi_monitor.py` | Standalone PyPI changelog poller (used for exploration) |
| `package_diff.py` | Download and diff two versions of any PyPI or npm package |
| `analyze_diff.py` | Send a diff to the selected LLM backend, parse verdict |
| `top_pypi_packages.py` | Fetch and list top N PyPI packages by download count |
| `slack.py` | Slack API client (SendMessage, PostFile) |
| `etc/slack.json` | Slack bot credentials |
| `last_serial.yaml` | Persisted polling state (PyPI serial + npm sequence/epoch) |
| `logs/` | Daily runtime log plus structured activity log (`monitor_YYYYMMDD.log`, `activity_YYYYMMDD.jsonl`) |

## Usage Details

### monitor.py — Main Orchestrator

```
python monitor.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --top N          Number of top packages to watch per ecosystem (default: 15000)
  --interval SECS  Poll interval in seconds (default: 300)
  --once           Single pass over recent events, then exit
  --slack          Enable Slack alerts for malicious findings
  --llm-backend    LLM backend for diff analysis (default: openai)
  --model MODEL    Override LLM model for the selected backend
  --debug          Enable DEBUG logging and network request diagnostics

PyPI options:
  --no-pypi        Disable PyPI monitoring
  --serial N       PyPI changelog serial to start from

npm options:
  --no-npm         Disable npm monitoring
  --npm-top N      Top N npm packages to watch (default: same as --top)
  --npm-seq N      npm replication sequence to start from
```

PyPI and npm each run in their own polling thread. Polling state (PyPI serial, npm sequence + epoch) is persisted to `last_serial.yaml` so the monitor resumes where it left off after a restart.

**PyPI pipeline:**
1. Loads the top N packages from the [hugovk/top-pypi-packages](https://hugovk.dev/top-pypi-packages/) dataset as a watchlist
2. Connects to PyPI's XML-RPC API and gets the current serial number
3. Every `--interval` seconds, calls `changelog_since_serial()` — a single API call that returns all events since the last check
4. Filters for `"new release"` events matching the watchlist
5. For each new release: downloads old + new versions (sdist and wheel when both exist), diffs, analyzes via LLM, and alerts Slack if malicious

**npm pipeline:**
1. Loads the top N packages from the [download-counts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/download-counts) dataset (falls back to npm search API)
2. Reads the current CouchDB replication sequence from `replicate.npmjs.com`
3. Every `--interval` seconds, fetches the `_changes` feed for all registry changes since the last sequence
4. Filters changed packages against the watchlist and checks for versions published after the last poll epoch
5. For each new release: downloads old + new tarballs from the npm registry, diffs, analyzes via LLM, and alerts Slack if malicious

All output is logged to both the console and `logs/monitor_YYYYMMDD.log`. In addition, the monitor writes structured JSONL activity records to `logs/activity_YYYYMMDD.jsonl`, including loop start/completion, package analysis start, verdicts, and errors.

### package_diff.py — Package Differ

```bash
# Compare two versions from PyPI
python package_diff.py requests 2.31.0 2.32.0

# Compare two versions from npm
python package_diff.py --npm express 4.18.2 4.19.0

# Save to file
python package_diff.py telnyx 2.0.0 2.1.0 -o telnyx_diff.md

# Compare local archives
python package_diff.py --local old.tar.gz new.tar.gz -n mypackage
```

Downloads are done directly via registry APIs (PyPI JSON API / npm registry), not pip or npm. This means:
- **No pip/npm dependency** for downloads
- **Platform-agnostic** — can download and diff Linux-only packages from Windows
- PyPI: prefers wheel (pure-Python when available), falls back to sdist
- npm: downloads tarballs directly from the registry

### analyze_diff.py — LLM Verdict

```bash
# Analyze a diff file
python analyze_diff.py telnyx_diff.md

# JSON output
python analyze_diff.py telnyx_diff.md --json

# Use a specific OpenAI-compatible model
python analyze_diff.py telnyx_diff.md --model gpt-4.1-mini

# Use Cursor instead
python analyze_diff.py telnyx_diff.md --backend cursor --model claude-4-opus
```

By default this sends the diff contents to an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and expects a structured verdict. Cursor remains available via `--backend cursor`, which runs the local `agent` CLI in read-only `ask` mode. Large diffs are truncated by `SCM_DIFF_CHAR_LIMIT` before the request is built, and OpenAI-compatible calls retry failed attempts up to `SCM_LLM_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times. Network diagnostics such as `[http] <- 200` and `[xmlrpc] <- ...` are printed only when `--debug` is set, or when `SCM_NETWORK_DEBUG=1` is exported for helper scripts.

Exit codes: `0` = benign, `1` = malicious, `2` = unknown/error.

### pypi_monitor.py — Standalone Poller

```bash
# See what's being released right now (last ~10 min)
python pypi_monitor.py --once --top 15000

# Continuous monitoring (console output only, no analysis)
python pypi_monitor.py --top 1000 --interval 120
```

Useful for exploring PyPI release velocity or debugging the changelog API without running the full analysis pipeline.

### top_pypi_packages.py — Package Rankings

```bash
# Print top 1000 packages
python top_pypi_packages.py
```

```python
# Use as a library
from top_pypi_packages import fetch_top_packages
packages = fetch_top_packages(top_n=500)
# [{"project": "boto3", "download_count": 1577565199}, ...]
```

## Data Sources

| Source | What | Rate Limits |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [hugovk/top-pypi-packages](https://hugovk.dev/top-pypi-packages/) | Top 15,000 PyPI packages by monthly downloads (monthly JSON) | None (static file) |
| [PyPI XML-RPC](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/xml-rpc.html) `changelog_since_serial()` | Real-time PyPI event firehose | Deprecated but functional; 1 call per poll is fine |
| [PyPI JSON API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html) | Package metadata, version history, download URLs | Generous; used sparingly (1 call per release) |
| [download-counts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/download-counts) (nice-registry) | Monthly download counts for every npm package (`counts.json`) | None (npm tarball) |
| [npm CouchDB replication](https://replicate.npmjs.com) `_changes` feed | Real-time npm registry change stream | Public; paginated reads |
| [npm registry API](https://registry.npmjs.org) | Package packuments, tarball downloads | Generous; used sparingly |

The monitor makes **1 API call per poll interval per ecosystem** (PyPI changelog / npm `_changes`), plus **2-3 calls per new release** (version history + downloads). This is very lightweight.

## Example Alerts

When the monitor detects a malicious release, it posts to Slack:

**PyPI:**
```
🚨 Supply Chain Alert: telnyx 4.87.2

Rank: #5,481 of top PyPI packages
Verdict: MALICIOUS
PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/telnyx/4.87.2/

Analysis summary (truncated):
The changes to src/telnyx/_client.py implement obfuscated
download-decrypt-execute behavior and module-import side effects.
A _d() function decodes base64 strings, a massive _p blob contains
an exfiltration script that downloads a .wav file from
http://83.142.209.203:8080/ringtone.wav and extracts a hidden
payload via steganography...
```

**npm:**
```
🚨 Supply Chain Alert: axios 0.30.4

Rank: #42 of top npm packages
Verdict: MALICIOUS
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios/v/0.30.4

Analysis summary (truncated):
1. **Non-standard dependency** — The `dependencies` block includes `plain-crypto-js`. Published axios only depends on `follow-redirects`, `form-data`, and `proxy-from-env`. A fourth package whose name looks like a **`crypto-js`–style typosquat** is a classic sign of a tampered or fake package, not a normal axios release.
```

## Limitations

- Releases are analyzed sequentially within each ecosystem thread. During high release volume, there will be a processing backlog.
- **LLM access required** — the default backend needs a reachable OpenAI-compatible endpoint and valid credentials. Cursor is optional, not required.
- **Large diffs may be truncated** before being sent to an OpenAI-compatible API. Adjust `SCM_DIFF_CHAR_LIMIT` if your model supports larger contexts; this is character-based, not token-based.
- **Cursor sandbox mode** (filesystem isolation) is only available on macOS/Linux. On Windows, the agent runs in read-only `ask` mode but without OS-level sandboxing.
- **Watchlists are static** — loaded once at startup from the hugovk (PyPI) and download-counts (npm) datasets. Restart to refresh.
- **npm _changes gap protection** — if the saved npm sequence falls more than 10,000 changes behind the registry head, the monitor resets to head to avoid a long catch-up. Releases during the gap are missed.

## Logging

Logs are written to both stdout and `logs/monitor_YYYYMMDD.log`. A new file is created each day. Both ecosystems log to the same file, with npm lines prefixed `[npm]`.

The monitor also writes structured JSONL events to `logs/activity_YYYYMMDD.jsonl`. This file is intended for audit trails and downstream processing. Each line is a JSON object with a UTC timestamp, event type, ecosystem, and event-specific fields such as package name, version, verdict, and analysis excerpt.
